  <h3>Delectable strawberry horchata</h3>
  <p>Horchata is a refreshing drink to make on a hot summer day.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups white rice, uncooked</li>
    <li>7 cups water, divided</li>
    <li>1 stick of cinnamon</li>
    <li>1lb strawberries</li>
    <li>1-2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>1 14oz evaporated milk</li>
    <li>Strawberries for garnishing</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>In large bowl, combine rice, 3 cups water, and cinnamon stick. Let sit for at least 30 minutes, but preferably overnight.</li>
    <li>After soaking rice, add rice along with the water and cinnamon stick into a blender. Blend on high until completely pulverized and mixture is smooth. This may take a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Using a strainer and cheese cloth, pour rice water into a 2-quart pitcher and discard any pulp.</li>
    <li>Rinse the blender and add strawberries, 1 cup sugar and 4 cups water. Blend until smooth. Using strainer, pour puree into rice water and stir. Add evaporated milk, if using.</li>
    <li>Taste to see if sweet enough. If more sugar is needed, add sugar into blender with a cup of horchata and blend to dissolve.</li>
    <li>If sweet enough, garnish with fresh sliced strawberries and pour into glass.</li>
  </ol>
